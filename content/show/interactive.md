# Light Beam Selfies For Everyone
This show was about so much more than just exploring our journey. We really wanted viewers to come in and reflect on journeys traveled or still in transit. What better way to have someone put themselves into this frame of reference than putting them in the art.

Simply walk up to the booth and **pickup the thingy** ( a *Leap Motion* IR device ) and **press the glowing doohicky** ( a sexy white trigger button powered by *Arduino* ).

## Selife Booth
Showing people in beams of light is pretty cool, but it was important that it wasn't perfect. We spent a great deal of time deciding where that fine line was between detail and abstraction.

## Selifes and Sleeves
Taking selifes would be pointless if you couldn't take them home. We printed the images on the fly at the event them packaged them in original hand-stamped wax-paper sleeves.

## Printing on the Fly
We used an iPad to allow someone select thier photos and a Canon Selfie printer for a fast and detailed print. We also had a black corkboard setup behind the exhibit where you could post selfies, if you wanted to contribute to the atmosphere of the entire event.

## Virtual Photography Booth
Just how the Selife Booth brought someone into the experience, we wanted someone to get a hands on experience of what it feels like it these living-breathing worlds. We setup a world using perlin noise and allowed anyone to create unique compositions using a process we call Virtual Photography.

## Controlled with a PS3 Controller
For taking our Virtual Photos we needed a lot of control. We mapped our camera rig to a PS3 Controller. You can do everything from taking a photo to changing your focus points just using the controller.

## Final Images Printed
Just like you could print our the selfies, you could print any original compositions you created using the Virtual Photography rig. What's the point of making something beautiful if you can't take it away with you?
