# The Pieces
*Auditorium* is a game where you bend beams of light to conduct a symphony orchestra. With this show, we wanted to pay homage to a game that has brought us so very far in our lives, both physically and emotionally. Keep in mind, this journey is far from over.

Each of the pieces you see on these walls are living, breathing pieces that we captured with what we call Virtual Photography. We created 5 pieces with both light and dark counterparts based on each musical movement, gameplay element, and emotional location in our upcoming sequel: *Auditorium Duet*. The dark pieces represent the past, while their light counterparts represent the future.

For each piece, we created a digital world using the popular game engine Unity3D—and a lot of ingenuity. Each section of Auditorium introduces a new way to play with light and sound. Each piece you see on the wall is not just a tribute to these sections of the game—they were actually created using the game itself.

Once we had a scene setup with the right motion and “feeling”, we then spent countless hours setting up our Virtual Camera to find those perfectly framed moments to capture. When the shots were chosen, they were sent to print with beautiful archival ink. 

In the world of Auditorium each movement is represented with a Sigil. These Sigils represent the motion, spirit, sound, and atmosphere of each world. Our final finishing touch was to hand-embellish these Sigils onto the finished pieces in metallic silver. The silver shines brightly, and casts a different light based on your viewing angle.

It is our hope that when you look back at how far you’ve come on your journey, you will also appreciate it from the myriad angles of life.

#### Mechanic: Directionals | Inspiration: Wind

We look out on the morning; a single cloud on the horizon. It beckons us onward, thoughts scattered to the four winds. We have traveled so far, but our journey is far from over…

We stand witness to a rare event: the firestorm. The flames streak from ground to sky, swallowing all in its path. This landscape will not be the same for some time; neither, we suspect, will we.

####Mechanic: Repel | Inspiration: Water

We make camp on the riverbank; to rest, yes, but also to remember. The waterfall stands frozen, a moment captured in time. Light plays tricks in this place, illuminating the path behind us; a reminder of home.

We walk into the earth. Our voices crash against every surface, forming a pattern as intricate as the rocks worn smooth with time. We venture forward with only the echoes to keep us company.

We arrive at a hidden waypoint. The energy of this city hums and swirls around us, a force of nature unto itself. Our trajectory has been forever affected by the irresistible gravity of the metropolis.
