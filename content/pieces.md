# The Pieces
Each piece was hand crafted with love.

## Onward and Upward
***
#### Mechanic: Directionals | Inspiration: Wind

We look out on the morning; a single cloud on the horizon. It beckons us onward, thoughts scattered to the four winds. We have traveled so far, but our journey is far from overâ€¦


![Whirling Firestorm][Whirling Firestorm]
## Whirling Firestorm
***
#### Mechanic: Attract | Inspiration: Fire

We stand witness to a rare event: the firestorm. The flames streak from ground to sky, swallowing all in its path. This landscape will not be the same for some time; neither, we suspect, will we.


![Moment of Reflection][Moment of Reflection]
## Moment of Reflection
***
####Mechanic: Repel | Inspiration: Water

We make camp on the riverbank; to rest, yes, but also to remember. The waterfall stands frozen, a moment captured in time. Light plays tricks in this place, illuminating the path behind us; a reminder of home.


![Untamed Ricochet][Untamed Ricochet]
## Untamed Ricochet
***
#### Mechanic: Deflect | Inspiration: Earth

We walk into the earth. Our voices crash against every surface, forming a pattern as intricate as the rocks worn smooth with time. We venture forward with only the echoes to keep us company.


![Escape Velocity][Escape Velocity]
## Escape Velocity
***
#### Mechanic: Lens | Inspiration: Gravity

We arrive at a hidden waypoint. The energy of this city hums and swirls around us, a force of nature unto itself. Our trajectory has been forever affected by the irresistible gravity of the metropolis.
