# The Story
*[Auditorium]* marked the beginning of [Cipher Prime], [Dain Saint] and [Will Stallwood]’s development studio. The duo returned to that humble beginning to create *[Auditorium Duet]*, a sequel designed to explore the sacred space of their collaborative process. Since 2012, the project has followed a long and emotionally taxing journey. *Duet* is not yet finished, and Cipher Prime is still working hard.
 
*”We’ve Traveled So Far…”* is a celebration of that on-going journey. 
 
This exhibit showcases the light-bending mechanics of *Duet*’s signature controls, vibrantly rendered colours, rich graphic design, and lush orchestration. This living world, captured with virtual photography and painstakingly hand-embellished, is now yours to witness.

### *Selfie Light Booth*

We’ve all heard, “it’s about the journey, no the destination”. That’s a beautiful and true sentiment, but it also forgets the observer. With this show we wanted to bring up thoughts our your personal journeys and destinations. What better way to bring you into this world, than to physically bring you into it. Take selfies as liquid light pours down your face.

### *Light Photography Booth*

A big part of the show was based around this multi-media technology we created. Each world was hand-crafted to have a feeling and mood, then shot through a process we call virtual photography. We created a unique piece for so you can capture your own perspective.

# [The Future][Pieces]

[![Large Pieces][Large Pieces]][Pieces]

The show featured 5 Large pieces that each represent a mood, game mechanic, and also element present in the beautiful world of Auditorium. These pieces speak of the promise to build a unique light musical world.

# [The Past][Pieces]

[![Medium Pieces][Medium Pieces]][Pieces]

Each Large Piece has it’s own dark counterpart. These pieces represent the past, showing a large resemblance from our very first game made in 2008. At the same time, they show a duality and sameness of the future pieces sharing the exact same visual composition and color.
