# The Story
![Cipher Prime Team][Cipher Prime Team]

*[Auditorium]* marked the beginning of [Cipher Prime], [Dain Saint] and [Will Stallwood]’s development studio. The duo returned to that humble beginning to create *[Auditorium Duet]*, a sequel designed to explore the sacred space of their collaborative process. Since 2012, the project has followed a long and emotionally taxing journey. *Duet* is not yet finished, and Cipher Prime is still working hard.
 
*"We’ve Traveled So Far..."* is a celebration of that on-going journey. 
 
This exhibit showcases the light-bending mechanics of *Duet*’s signature controls, vibrantly rendered colours, rich graphic design, and lush orchestration. This living world, captured with virtual photography and painstakingly hand-embellished, is now yours to witness.
