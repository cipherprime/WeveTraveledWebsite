*[Auditorium]* marked the beginning of [Cipher Prime], [Dain Saint] and [Will Stallwood]’s development studio. The duo returned to that humble beginning to create *[Auditorium Duet]*, a sequel designed to explore the sacred space of their collaborative process. Since 2012, the project has followed a long and emotionally taxing journey. *Duet* is not yet finished, and Cipher Prime is still working hard.
 
*“We’ve Traveled So Far…”* is a celebration of that on-going journey. 
 
This exhibit showcases the light-bending mechanics of *Duet*’s signature controls, vibrantly rendered colours, rich graphic design, and lush orchestration. This living world, captured with virtual photography and painstakingly hand-embellished, is now yours to witness.


## The Pieces

![Onward and Upward][Onward and Upward]
#### Onward and Upward
Mechanic: Directionals | Inspiration: Wind

We look out on the morning; a single cloud on the horizon. It beckons us onward, thoughts scattered to the four winds. We have traveled so far, but our journey is far from over…

![Whirling Firestorm][Whirling Firestorm]
#### Whirling Firestorm
Mechanic: Attract | Inspiration: Fire

We stand witness to a rare event: the firestorm. The flames streak from ground to sky, swallowing all in its path. This landscape will not be the same for some time; neither, we suspect, will we.

![Moment of Reflection][Moment of Reflection]
#### Moment of Reflection
Mechanic: Repel | Inspiration: Water

We make camp on the riverbank; to rest, yes, but also to remember. The waterfall stands frozen, a moment captured in time. Light plays tricks in this place, illuminating the path behind us; a reminder of home.

![Untamed Ricochet][Untamed Ricochet]
#### Untamed Ricochet
Mechanic: Deflect | Inspiration: Earth

We walk into the earth. Our voices crash against every surface, forming a pattern as intricate as the rocks worn smooth with time. We venture forward with only the echoes to keep us company.

![Escape Velocity][Escape Velocity]
#### Escape Velocity
Mechanic: Lens | Inspiration: Gravity

We arrive at a hidden waypoint. The energy of this city hums and swirls around us, a force of nature unto itself. Our trajectory has been forever affected by the irresistible gravity of the metropolis.
