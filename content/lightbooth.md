# The Light Booth
*Auditorium Duet*, more than anything else, is meant to bring people together. We wanted to reflect that by putting you in the experience.

The [Leap Motion] device you are holding was originally designed to track hand motions for computer input. It houses two infrared (IR) sensors that detect the distance to objects in its field of view. By repurposing those sensors, we are able to generate a three-dimensional representation of the real world within *Duet*. Watch the beams of light ebb and flow around your faceâ€”and most importantly, have fun!
